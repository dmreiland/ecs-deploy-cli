# deploy-ecs

`deploy-ecs` is a simple and easy way to deploy tasks and update services in AWS ECS.

Just write your task definition in `task.json` and upload them straight to AWS using `deploy-ecs`.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install -g deploy-ecs
```

To be able to deploy to AWS you need to have installed the `aws-cli` and configured it to use the the account you wish to upload the function to.

## Configuration

To upload automatically to AWS you need to configure your task functions in the file `task.json`.

### Example task

```json
{
    "family": "node-task",
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "memory": 300,
            "essential": true,
            "name": "node",
            "image": "node",
            "logConfiguration": {
                "logDriver": "awslogs",
                "options": {
                    "awslogs-group": "node-task",
                    "awslogs-region": "eu-west-1"
                }
            },
            "cpu": 200
        }
    ],
}
```

For a more detailed task definition see the DOCS for the [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/register-task-definition.html).
